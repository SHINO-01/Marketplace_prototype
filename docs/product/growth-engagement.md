# Growth & Engagement Roadmap

## Gamification
- **Badges Framework**: Introduce badge definitions stored in Catalog Service (`badges` table) referencing thresholds (downloads, revenue, reviews).
- **Creator Progression**: Bronze/Silver/Gold tiers unlock higher payout limits and featured placement eligibility.
- **Reviewer Rewards**: Verified reviewers earn XP for detailed feedback; XP convertible to discount vouchers.
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Event-driven updates via Kafka topics (`review.submitted`, `asset.downloaded`).
  - Badge eligibility computed by Engagement Service cron jobs.
  - UI surfaces progress bars on `dashboard` and profile pages.

## Leaderboards
- **Types**: Most downloaded assets, top-rated assets, fastest growing creators, seasonal challenge winners.
- **Storage**: Redis sorted sets updated in near-real-time; nightly job recalculates long-term stats.
- **UI**: Dedicated leaderboard section on homepage and dashboard widgets.
- **Integration**: Admin Service controls exposure (enable/disable boards, adjust timespans).

## Referral & Affiliate Program
- **Referral Codes**: Users generate unique codes; new sign-ups credited after first purchase.
- **Affiliate Tracking**: UTM parameters stored in PostgreSQL; payout pipeline calculates commissions monthly.
- **Compliance**: Integrate with Payment Service for affiliate payouts; include anti-fraud heuristics.

## Notifications & Messaging
- **Email Notifications**: Templates managed in Notification Service; triggered on followed creator releases, asset updates, milestone badges.
- **Channels**: Email (SES/SendGrid), in-app notifications, optional Discord webhook.
- **Preference Center**: Users manage notification preferences under account settings (GDPR compliant).

## Seasonal Events & Campaigns
- **Admin Controls**: Admin dashboard toggles seasonal events, sets themed collections, applies timed coupons.
- **Content Pipeline**: Catalog Service supports `event_tags`. Homepage surfaces event hero sections.
- **Scheduling**: Cron scheduler (Temporal/Airflow) activates events and rolls back automatically.

## Subscription & Membership Tiers
- **Tiers**:
  - Free: Limited monthly downloads, access to community events.
  - Pro: Monthly credits, exclusive assets, creator analytics.
  - Studio/Enterprise: Team seats, bulk licensing, priority support, API quotas.
- **Billing**: Commerce Service integrates Stripe Billing for subscription management; Payment Service handles invoicing.
- **Access Control**: Feature flags keyed by tier (e.g., `feature.asset-finder.pro`).
- **Usage Tracking**: Metering service tracks download counts per tier and enforces limits.

## Engagement Metrics & Analytics
- **KPIs**: DAU/MAU, retention, referral conversion, badge adoption, notification CTR.
- **Dashboards**: Grafana boards pulling data from warehouse; segmented by tier and region.
- **Experimentation**: Feature flag platform (e.g., GrowthBook) enables A/B testing for engagement features.
