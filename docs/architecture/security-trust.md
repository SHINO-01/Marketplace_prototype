# Security & Trust Framework

## Upload Security
- **Malware Scanning**: Integrate with cloud antivirus (ClamAV/Limoto) triggered on asset upload before publication.
- **File Validation**: Checksum verification, file type sniffing, and schema validation to prevent disguised binaries.
- **Sandboxing**: Execute script/plugin validation in isolated containers with no outbound network access.

## License & DRM Controls
- **Download Tokens**: Time-bound signed URLs stored in Redis; enforced by CDN edge functions.
- **Watermarked Previews**: Generate watermark overlays for images/videos; audio previews include audio watermarking.
- **License Keys**: Commerce Service issues per-seat keys; validated via gateway on downloads and plugin activation.

## Authentication & Account Security
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Keycloak MFA using TOTP/SMS/email fallback.
- **Device Management**: Users view and revoke sessions; suspicious login detection triggers notifications.
- **RBAC/ABAC**: Role-based access plus attribute-based policies for admin features and enterprise tier privileges.

## Compliance & Privacy
- **GDPR/CCPA**: Data export/delete endpoints; consent tracking for marketing emails.
- **Data Minimization**: Pseudonymize user IDs in analytics pipelines; restrict PII storage to secure schemas.
- **DPA & Audit Trails**: Signed data processing agreements; audit logs stored in tamper-evident storage (e.g., AWS QLDB).

## Storage Security
- **Encryption**: S3 bucket encryption (SSE-KMS), PostgreSQL Transparent Data Encryption, Redis TLS.
- **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault issues short-lived credentials; rotation automated via Terraform + Vault policies.
- **Access Segmentation**: VPC subnet isolation, security groups per service, no direct public database access.

## Monitoring & Incident Response
- **SIEM**: OpenSearch Dashboards SIEM plugin with Sigma rules for threat detection.
- **Alerting**: Prometheus Alertmanager, PagerDuty integration for critical incidents.
- **Runbooks**: Documented procedures for compromise, data breach, DDoS mitigation.

## Audit Logging
- **Events Captured**: Admin actions, asset moderation decisions, payout adjustments, login attempts.
- **Retention**: Immutable storage for 7 years (configurable per compliance).
- **Access**: Only security team via just-in-time privileged access (PAM solution).

## Roadmap Enhancements
- Add hardware security key support (WebAuthn).
- Implement continuous compliance scanning (SOC 2 controls).
- Leverage machine learning for adaptive authentication scoring.
